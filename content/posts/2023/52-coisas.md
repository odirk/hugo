https://kottke.org/22/01/52-things-i-learned-in-2021-1

For the last few years, I’ve been a fan of Tom Whitwell’s annual list of 52 things he learned during the past year — here’s his list for 2021. This year, I kept track of my own list, presented here in no particular order:

1. [Fat Family - Jeito Sexy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6uUHqXmxfc) é [Diana King - Shy Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szjaHbjhauk).
   
2. Quando Jimmy Hendrix tocou em Woodstock, ele tinha uma cláusula contratual que ninguém mais poderia tocar depois dele. Devido a alguns problemas técnicos e de agendamento, [ele não tocou até as 9h da manhã de segunda-feira](https://www.history.com/news/remembering-richie-havens-ten-things-you-may-not-know-about-woodstock). A maioria das pessoas já tinha ido para casa e perdido seu set lendário.
3. O nome do [Boninho](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boninho) é José Bonifácio.
4. [J.J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Thomson) ganhou o Nobel de Física em 1906 quando mostrou que os elétrons eram **partículas**. Seu filho, [G. P. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Paget_Thomson), ganhou o Prêmio Nobel de Física em 1937 por mostrar que os elétrons são **ondas**. 
5. It’s important to recognize that in mouse years, Stuart Little was a middle aged man and his presence in an orphanage among children was problematic at best
6. No prime minister of Pakistan — a country that has swung between democracy and dictatorship — has ever completed a full term in office. https://www.ft.com/content/870369af-b673-4ce5-bd86-d89d28be4d40
7. Nintendo (founded 1889) and the Ottoman Empire coexisted (fell in 1922) for 33 years.
8. Sid Vicious (the wrestler) took his stage name from Sid Vicious (Sex Pistols) who was given his nickname from a hamster who was named after Syd Barrett (Pink Floyd) who took his name from Sid Barrett (jazz musician) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Eudy
9. Humans can smell some components of the smell of rain (the geosmin part of petrichor, specifically) far better than sharks can small blood in water. https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/07/28/geosmin-why-we-smell-air-after-storm-13240
10. TIL the US didn’t have the $15m to pay France for Louisiana, so they financed it through a banks in London. Napoleon had made the deal with the US to fund his war against Great Britain and Europe. Britain allowed this deal to go through only because they didn’t want France to have their NA territory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase#Financing
11. Ciabatta was invented in 1982 by Italian bakers who wanted to rival French baguettes. Maybe you already knew this https://www.eater.com/2017/2/17/14625136/artisan-bread-history
12. Sodium Citrate is the secret ingredient to make any cheese into smooth, creamy nacho cheese sauce. Coincidentally, Sodium Citrate's chemical formula is Na3C6H5O7 (NaCHO). https://www.cooksillustrated.com/science/830-articles/story/cooks-science-explains-sodium-citrate
13.     When pilgrims were landing on Plymouth Rock, you could already visit what is now Santa Fe, New Mexico to stay at a hotel, eat at a restaurant and buy Native American silver.
14.     Prisoners began to arrive to Auschwitz a few days after McDonald’s was founded.
15.     The first wagon train of the Oregon Trail heads out the same year the fax machine is invented.
16.     Nintendo was founded in 1888. Jack the Ripper was on the loose in 1888.
17.     1912 saw the maiden voyage of the Titanic as well as the birth of vitamins, x-ray crystallography, and MDMA.
18.     1971: The year in which America drove a lunar buggy on the moon and Switzerland gave women the vote.
19.     NASA’s Gemini program was winding down at the same time as plate tectonics, as we know it today, was becoming refined and accepted by the scientific community.
20.     Spain was still a fascist dictatorship when Microsoft was founded.
21.     There were no classes in calculus in Harvard’s curriculum for the first few years because calculus hadn’t been discovered yet.
22.     Two empires [Roman & Ottoman] spanned the entire gap from Jesus to Babe Ruth.
23.     When the pyramids were being built, there were still woolly mammoths.
24.     The last use of the guillotine was in France the same year Star Wars came out.
25.     Oxford University was over 300 years old when the Aztec Empire was founded.
26.     38 years and 8 months ago, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, the action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford, is released, closer to World War II than to today. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom

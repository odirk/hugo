My favorite bits from Francis Bacon’s Of Discourse

    don’t be tedious
    let other people talk
    if someone is hogging, cut him off
    ask questions that people can look good answering
    don’t be a poser with smartass questions
    don’t bitch about others
    eloquence is overrated
    It’s Not About You

My favorite bits from George Washington’s Rules of Civility & Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation:

    Respect others
    If your friend has lice, remove it privately
    When visiting the sick, don’t play physician
    “Undertake not to teach your equal in the art himself professes”
    Take all admonition thankfully
    Use no reproachful language
    ”Be not hasty to believe flying reports to the disparagement of any”
    Associate with quality people
    No malice or envy
    Don’t intimidate the ignorant
    Don’t ruin the mood; if someone else does, fix it
    Don’t laugh at others’ misfortune
    Be courteous
    Give not advice without being asked
    Reprehend not the imperfection of others
    Gaze not on the blemishes of others and ask not how they came
    Think before you speak
    When another speaks, be attentive and do not interrupt
    Don’t relate news if you don’t know the truth
    Be not tedious in discourse
    Be not curious to know the affairs of others
    In disputes, be not desirous to overcome; give liberty to each to deliver his opinion
    Be not angry at the table whatever happens

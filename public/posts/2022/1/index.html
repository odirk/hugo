don’t be tedious
let other people talk
if someone is hogging, cut him off
ask questions that people can look good answering
don’t be a poser with smartass questions
don’t bitch about others
eloquence is overrated
It’s Not About You

My favorite bits from George Washington’s Rules of Civility & Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation:
Respect others
If your friend has lice, remove it privately
When visiting the sick, don’t play physician
“Undertake not to teach your equal in the art himself professes”
Take all admonition thankfully
Use no reproachful language
”Be not hasty to believe flying reports to the disparagement of any”
Associate with quality people
No malice or envy
Don’t intimidate the ignorant
Don’t ruin the mood; if someone else does, fix it
Don’t laugh at others’ misfortune
Be courteous
Give not advice without being asked
Reprehend not the imperfection of others
Gaze not on the blemishes of others and ask not how they came
Think before you speak
When another speaks, be attentive and do not interrupt
Don’t relate news if you don’t know the truth
Be not tedious in discourse
Be not curious to know the affairs of others
In disputes, be not desirous to overcome; give liberty to each to deliver his opinion
Be not angry at the table whatever happens
